# Structured Data SPA (Extra)

This is a single-page React + Vite app built for practicing the Structured Data
workshop skills. The UI is wired up to helper functions that you will implement.

## Where to practice

- <InlineFile file="src/utils/practice.ts" /> — implement each utility
- <InlineFile file="src/data/library-data.ts" /> — sample data used by the app
- <InlineFile file="src/app.tsx" /> — UI that renders the results
