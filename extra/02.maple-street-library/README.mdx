# Maple Street Library

This is a single-page React + Vite app for the Maple Street Library team. The UI
is wired up to helper functions that you will implement.

👨‍💼 We need this dashboard to show accurate library activity. Your task is to
complete the helper utilities so the catalog, rooms, events, and member activity
sections all populate with real data.

## Your assignment

- <InlineFile file="src/utils/practice.ts" /> — implement the utilities for the
  dashboard
- <InlineFile file="src/data/library-data.ts" /> — review the live dataset
- <InlineFile file="src/app.tsx" /> — confirm the UI renders accurate results
