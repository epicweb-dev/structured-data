## Summary

Workshop completed successfully. All 17 exercises passed without any material issues affecting learning or correctness.

### Overall Assessment

**Learning Outcomes**: ✅ Excellent
- Each exercise clearly introduces a specific concept
- Progression from basic to advanced is well-paced
- Real-world context (inventory system, user management, etc.) makes concepts relatable

**Instructional Clarity**: ✅ Excellent
- Instructions are explicit and include helpful hints (💰 syntax examples)
- Each README provides sufficient context before jumping in
- Links to official documentation provided for deeper learning

**Cognitive Load**: ✅ Appropriate
- Each exercise focuses on one concept at a time
- No overwhelming jumps in complexity
- Good balance between theory (section READMEs) and practice (problem files)

**Examples and Exercise Alignment**: ✅ Consistent
- Syntax shown in hints matches expected solutions
- Naming conventions are consistent throughout
- Patterns introduced early are reinforced later (e.g., reduce shows up in both array iteration and formal reduce exercise)

**Mechanical Correctness**: ✅ Working
- All commands worked as documented
- Test files run correctly
- EpicShop CLI commands function properly
- No environment issues encountered
