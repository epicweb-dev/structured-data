# Maps and Sets

Objects and arrays are common, but JavaScript also provides specialized data
structures for certain jobs:

- **`Map`** - key/value pairs with any key type
- **`Set`** - a collection of unique values

These are great for lookups, caching, and deduplication.

	JavaScript also has **WeakMap** and **WeakSet** for object keys that can be
	garbage-collected when nothing else references them. We'll just mention them
	in passing here, but they're useful for caching without memory leaks.

In this exercise, you'll use `Map` for fast lookup and `Set` for unique values.
