# Maps and Sets

👨‍💼 Great work! You used `Map` for fast lookups and `Set` for unique values.

You learned:

- 🧭 **`Map`** for key/value storage with any key type
- 🧹 **`Set`** for deduplicating values
- 🔁 Converting between arrays and sets/maps

These tools are perfect when objects and arrays don't fit the job.
