# Structured Data

👨‍💼 Congratulations! You've completed the Structured Data workshop! 🎉

You now know how to model complex data in TypeScript:

- **Objects** group related values with named properties
- **Arrays** store collections of the same type
- **Spread/Rest** enables immutable updates and variable arguments
- **Destructuring** extracts values from objects and arrays cleanly
- **Tuples** provide fixed-length, positionally-typed arrays
- **Array methods** (`map`, `filter`, `reduce`) transform data functionally
- **Enums** (and union types) give names to related constants

📝 Take a moment to reflect:

- How will you use objects to model data in your projects?
- When would you choose a tuple over an object?
- What's your preference: enums or string unions?

🦉 **Key insight**: Good data modeling is the foundation of good code. When your
types accurately represent your domain, bugs become impossible to write.

## What's Next?

In the next workshop, **Type Modeling and Type Safety**, you'll learn advanced
type techniques: type aliases, interfaces, union types, and more. You'll
discover how to make "illegal states unrepresentable."

Keep building! 🏗️
