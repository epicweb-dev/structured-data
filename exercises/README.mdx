# Structured Data 📦

👨‍💼 Welcome back! In the previous workshop, you mastered primitive types. Now
it's time to work with **structured data**—the way real applications organize
information.

In this workshop, we'll explore **how to model real data, not just primitives**.

We'll cover:

1. **Objects** - Grouping related data together with named properties
2. **Arrays** - Working with lists of values
3. **Spread and Rest** - Immutable updates and variable arguments
4. **Destructuring** - Extracting values from objects and arrays cleanly
5. **Array Methods** - Transforming data with `map`, `filter`, and `reduce`
6. **Object Methods** - Turning objects into arrays and back again
7. **Maps and Sets** - Specialized data structures for lookup and uniqueness

	This workshop moves you from writing "scripts" to building data-driven
	programs. You'll learn patterns used in every real-world TypeScript
	application.

By the end of this workshop, you'll be able to:

- Define and work with typed objects
- Create and manipulate arrays with type safety
- Use spread/rest for immutable updates and flexible functions
- Extract values cleanly with destructuring
- Transform data with functional array methods
- Read and transform objects with built-in object methods
- Use maps for lookups and sets for uniqueness

Let's model some data! 📊
