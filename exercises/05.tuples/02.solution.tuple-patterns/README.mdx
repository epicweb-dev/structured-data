# Tuple Patterns

👨‍💼 Excellent! You've mastered tuple return patterns.

🦉 The `[value, error]` or `[value, success]` pattern is common in TypeScript.
It's inspired by Go's error handling pattern.

Benefits:

- Forces callers to handle both success and failure
- No need for try/catch in many cases
- Types are explicit about what can happen

You'll see this pattern used in many libraries and APIs.
