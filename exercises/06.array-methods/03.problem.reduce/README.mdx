# Reduce

👨‍💼 The `reduce` method accumulates an array into a single value. It's the most
powerful (and sometimes confusing) array method—and a cornerstone of functional
programming.

```ts
const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4]
const sum = numbers.reduce((acc, n) => acc + n, 0)
// 10
```

Parameters:

- **accumulator** (`acc`) - The running total
- **current** (`n`) - The current element
- **initial value** (`0`) - Starting point

🐨 Open <InlineFile file="index.ts" /> and:

1. Use `reduce` to sum all prices
2. Use `reduce` to find the most expensive product
3. Use `reduce` to count products by category

💰 Reduce syntax:

```ts
const result = array.reduce((accumulator, current) => newAccumulator, initial)
```

💰 Counting by category (immutable pattern using spread):

```ts
const counts = products.reduce(
	(acc, p) => ({
		...acc,
		[p.category]: (acc[p.category] || 0) + 1,
	}),
	{} as Record<string, number>,
)
```

Each iteration returns a new object instead of mutating the accumulator. This
is the functional approach—easier to reason about and debug.
