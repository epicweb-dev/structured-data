# Object Spread

👨‍💼 Excellent! You've mastered immutable object updates with spread.

🦉 Key insights:

1. **Spread creates shallow copies** - Properties are copied, but nested objects
   are still references
2. **Order matters** - Later spreads override earlier properties
3. **Nested updates need nested spreads** - Each level needs its own `...`

This pattern is fundamental to React:

```ts
// Updating state immutably
setState((prev) => ({ ...prev, count: prev.count + 1 }))

// Updating nested state
setState((prev) => ({
	...prev,
	user: { ...prev.user, name: newName },
}))
```

Without spread, you'd have to manually copy every property. Spread makes
immutable updates concise and readable.
