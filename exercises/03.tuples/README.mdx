# Tuples

Tuples are arrays with a **fixed length** and **specific types at each
position**. They're like arrays, but more structured.

```ts
// Array: any number of strings
const names: Array<string> = ['Alice', 'Bob']

// Tuple: exactly two elements, string then number
const person: [string, number] = ['Alice', 30]
```

## When to Use Tuples

Tuples are great for:

- **Returning multiple values** from functions
- **Coordinates** like `[x, y]` or `[lat, long]`
- **Key-value pairs** like `[key, value]`
- **Named positions** where order matters

```ts
function getNameAndAge(): [string, number] {
	return ['Alice', 30]
}

const [name, age] = getNameAndAge() // Destructuring!
```

## Tuple vs Object

When should you use each?

```ts
// Tuple - positional, compact
const point: [number, number] = [10, 20]

// Object - named, self-documenting
const point = { x: 10, y: 20 }
```

<callout-info>
	Use tuples when position is meaningful and the data is simple. Use objects
	when you need named properties or the structure is complex.

In this exercise, you'll work with tuples for structured return values.
