# Tuples

👨‍💼 Great work with tuples! You now understand:

- 📍 **Fixed-length arrays** with specific types per position
- 🔄 **Destructuring** to extract tuple values
- ↩️ **Function returns** using tuples for multiple values
- ⚖️ **Tuple vs object** tradeoffs

🦉 A common real-world tuple pattern is React's `useState`:

```ts
const [count, setCount] = useState(0)
// Returns [number, function] tuple
```

This pattern works because the positions are well-defined and the structure is
simple.
