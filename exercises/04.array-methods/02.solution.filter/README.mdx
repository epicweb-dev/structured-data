# Filter

👨‍💼 Great filtering! You've seen how to chain methods for complex queries.

🦉 Method chaining is powerful but can get long. For readability, put each
method on its own line:

```ts
const result = products
	.filter((p) => p.inStock)
	.filter((p) => p.category === 'Electronics')
	.filter((p) => p.price < 500)
	.map((p) => p.name)
```

Each line is one transformation—easy to read and modify.
