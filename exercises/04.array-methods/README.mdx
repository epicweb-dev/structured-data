# Array Methods

Array methods let you transform data declaratively. Instead of writing loops,
you describe _what_ you want to happen.

## The Big Three

### `map` - Transform each element

```ts
const numbers = [1, 2, 3]
const doubled = numbers.map((n) => n * 2)
// [2, 4, 6]
```

### `filter` - Keep elements that pass a test

```ts
const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
const evens = numbers.filter((n) => n % 2 === 0)
// [2, 4]
```

### `reduce` - Accumulate into a single value

```ts
const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4]
const sum = numbers.reduce((acc, n) => acc + n, 0)
// 10
```

## Why Use Array Methods?

1. **More readable** - Intent is clear
2. **Less error-prone** - No off-by-one errors
3. **Chainable** - Combine operations fluently
4. **Type-safe** - TypeScript infers types through the chain

```ts
const result = products
	.filter((p) => p.inStock)
	.map((p) => p.price)
	.reduce((sum, price) => sum + price, 0)
```

These methods don't mutate the original array—they return new arrays. This makes
code easier to reason about.
