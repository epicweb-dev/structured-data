# Reduce

👨‍💼 Excellent! You've tackled `reduce`, the most versatile array method.

🦉 `reduce` can do almost anything, but that doesn't mean you should use it for
everything. Often `map` + `filter` is clearer:

```ts
// Using reduce (clever but harder to read)
const total = products.reduce(
	(sum, p) => (p.inStock ? sum + p.price : sum),
	0,
)

// Using filter + reduce (clearer intent)
const total = products
	.filter((p) => p.inStock)
	.reduce((sum, p) => sum + p.price, 0)
```

Use `reduce` when you need:

- Sums/averages
- Finding min/max
- Grouping/counting
- Building objects from arrays
