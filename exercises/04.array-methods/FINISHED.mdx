# Array Methods

👨‍💼 Fantastic work! You've mastered functional array methods.

You learned:

- 🔄 **`map`** transforms each element
- 🔍 **`filter`** keeps elements matching a condition
- 📊 **`reduce`** accumulates into a single value
- ⛓️ **Chaining** combines operations fluently

🦉 These methods are the foundation of functional programming in JavaScript and
TypeScript. They appear everywhere:

- React components mapping data to JSX
- Data processing pipelines
- API response transformations

```ts
// Real-world example: transform API data
const userNames = apiResponse.users
	.filter((user) => user.isActive)
	.map((user) => user.displayName)
```
