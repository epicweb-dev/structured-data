# Object Entries and fromEntries

👨‍💼 We need to apply a discount to all prices in our catalog and return a new
object with updated values.

🐨 Open <InlineFile file="index.ts" /> and:

1. Use `Object.entries` to get the catalog entries
2. Use `map` to apply a 10% discount to each price
3. Use `Object.fromEntries` to build the discounted object

💰 `Object.fromEntries` expects an array of `[key, value]` tuples. Keep each
entry as a two-item array.
