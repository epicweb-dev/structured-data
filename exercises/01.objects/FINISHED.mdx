# Objects

👨‍💼 Great work! You now know how to create and work with typed objects.

You learned:

- 📦 **Object literals** group related data together
- 🔑 **Property access** with dot and bracket notation
- ❓ **Optional properties** with the `?` modifier
- 🔒 **Type checking** ensures you don't access non-existent properties

🦉 In later workshops, you'll learn about `interface` and `type` keywords that
make object types reusable and more powerful. For now, inline object types work
great for learning the fundamentals.
