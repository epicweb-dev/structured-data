# Objects

👨‍💼 Great work! You now know how to create and work with typed objects.

You learned:

- 📦 **Object literals** group related data together
- 🏷️ **Type aliases** name object shapes for reuse
- 🔑 **Property access** with dot and bracket notation
- ❓ **Optional properties** with the `?` modifier
- 🧭 **Dynamic keys** using bracket notation and index signatures
- 🔒 **Type checking** ensures you don't access non-existent properties

🦉 We'll explore `interface` and go deeper on type aliases in the Type Safety
workshop. For now, inline object types still work great—use them when it keeps
things simpler.

Next up: Arrays—working with collections of data!
