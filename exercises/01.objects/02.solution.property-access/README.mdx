# Property Access

👨‍💼 You've seen how TypeScript protects you from accessing non-existent
properties!

When you tried to access `product.rating`, TypeScript said:

```
Property 'rating' does not exist on type '{ name: string; ... }'
```

🦉 This is one of TypeScript's core benefits—catching typos and missing
properties at compile time instead of getting `undefined` at runtime.

Notice how the function parameter uses an inline object type. The function only
requires `name` and `price`, so it can accept any object that has at least those
properties.
