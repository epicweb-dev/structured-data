# Objects

Objects are the fundamental way to group related data in TypeScript. Instead of
having separate variables, you combine them into a single structure.

```ts
// Without objects - scattered data
const userName = 'Alice'
const userAge = 30
const userEmail = 'alice@example.com'

// With objects - organized data
const user = {
	name: 'Alice',
	age: 30,
	email: 'alice@example.com',
}
```

## Typing Objects

TypeScript can infer object types, but you can also be explicit:

```ts
const user: { name: string; age: number; email: string } = {
	name: 'Alice',
	age: 30,
	email: 'alice@example.com',
}
```

## Property Access

Access properties with dot notation or bracket notation:

```ts
console.log(user.name) // "Alice"
console.log(user['email']) // "alice@example.com"
```

## Optional Properties

Not every property is always present. Use `?` for optional properties:

```ts
const user: { name: string; nickname?: string } = {
	name: 'Alice',
	// nickname is optional, so we can omit it
}
```

	Objects in TypeScript are the building blocks for modeling real-world entities
	like users, products, orders, and more.

In this exercise, you'll create and work with typed objects.
