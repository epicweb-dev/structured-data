# Object Literals

👨‍💼 Perfect! You've created typed objects.

🦉 Notice we had to repeat the type annotation for both `user` and `admin`.
That's repetitive! In the Type Safety workshop, you'll learn how to create
reusable type aliases:

```ts
type User = { name: string; age: number; email: string }

const user: User = { ... }
const admin: User = { ... }
```

For now, understanding the inline syntax is the foundation for those more
advanced patterns.
