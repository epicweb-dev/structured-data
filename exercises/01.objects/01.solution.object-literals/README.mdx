# Object Literals

👨‍💼 Perfect! You've created objects!

🦉 In the Type Safety workshop, you'll learn how to write reusable object types
with type aliases or interfaces:

```ts
type User = { name: string; age: number; email: string }

const user: User = { ... }
const admin: User = { ... }
```

For now, object literals are enough to get started.
