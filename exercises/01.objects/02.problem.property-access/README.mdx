# Property Access

👨‍💼 We need to read and work with object properties. TypeScript ensures you
can only access properties that exist on an object.

There are two ways to access properties:

```ts
// Dot notation - most common
user.name

// Bracket notation - useful for dynamic keys
user['name']
```

🐨 Open <InlineFile file="index.ts" /> and:

1. Access properties using dot notation
2. Create a function that takes a product object and returns a formatted string
3. Try accessing a property that doesn't exist (see the error!)

💰 Functions can accept objects as parameters.
