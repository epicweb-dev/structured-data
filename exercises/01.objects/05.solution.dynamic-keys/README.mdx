# Dynamic Object Keys

👨‍💼 Nice work! You used computed property names to create keys like "404-status".

🦉 The key idea is a **computed property name**, which lets you use a variable
as the key when creating the object:

```ts
const key = 'status-404'
const errorPages = {
	[key]: '/not-found',
}
```

This pattern is useful when a property name isn't a valid identifier.
