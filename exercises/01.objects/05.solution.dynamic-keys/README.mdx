# Dynamic Object Keys

👨‍💼 Nice work! You used bracket notation to write and read dynamic keys.

🦉 The key idea is an **index signature**, which lets you say "any string key
maps to a number value":

```ts
type PageViews = { [page: string]: number }
const pageViews: PageViews = {}
const page = 'home'
pageViews[page] = 1
```

This pattern is common for lookup tables, counts, and dictionaries.
