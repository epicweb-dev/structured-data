# Spread and Rest

👨‍💼 Excellent! You've mastered the `...` operator in both its forms.

You learned:

- 📤 **Array spread** - Expand arrays: `[...arr, newItem]`
- 📦 **Object spread** - Expand objects: `{ ...obj, newProp: value }`
- 📥 **Rest parameters** - Collect arguments: `function fn(...args)`
- 🔄 **Immutable updates** - Create new objects/arrays instead of mutating

🦉 The key distinction:

| Context               | Name   | Effect                       |
| --------------------- | ------ | ---------------------------- |
| `[...arr]`            | Spread | Expands into elements        |
| `{ ...obj }`          | Spread | Expands into properties      |
| `fn(...arr)`          | Spread | Expands as function args     |
| `function fn(...x)`   | Rest   | Collects args into array     |
| `const [a, ...rest]`  | Rest   | Collects remaining elements  |
| `const { a, ...rest}` | Rest   | Collects remaining props     |

These patterns are foundational for:

- React state updates
- Redux reducers
- Utility functions
- Any immutable data manipulation

You're now equipped to write modern, immutable TypeScript code! 🎉
