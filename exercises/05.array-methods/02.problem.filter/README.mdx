# Filter

👨‍💼 The `filter` method creates a new array with only elements that pass a
test.

```ts
const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
const evens = numbers.filter((n) => n % 2 === 0)
// [2, 4]
```

The callback returns `true` to keep the element or `false` to exclude it.

🐨 Open <InlineFile file="index.ts" /> and:

1. Filter products by category
2. Filter products by price range
3. Chain `filter` with `map`

💰 `filter` keeps items where your callback returns true.
