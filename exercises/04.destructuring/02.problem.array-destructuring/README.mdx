# Array Destructuring

👨‍💼 Array destructuring extracts elements by position. It's especially useful for
working with tuples, function return values, and APIs that return arrays.

```ts
const colors = ['red', 'green', 'blue']
const [first, second, third] = colors
// first = 'red', second = 'green', third = 'blue'
```

## Skipping Elements

Use empty slots to skip elements you don't need:

```ts
const [, , third] = colors // third = 'blue'
```

## Rest Pattern

Collect remaining elements into a new array:

```ts
const [head, ...rest] = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
// head = 1, rest = [2, 3, 4, 5]
```

<callout-info>
	The spread/rest syntax was covered in Exercise 3. The `...rest` pattern here
	collects remaining array elements into a new array.

## Swapping Variables

Destructuring enables elegant swaps:

```ts
let a = 1
let b = 2
;[a, b] = [b, a] // a = 2, b = 1
```

🐨 Open <InlineFile file="index.ts" /> and:

1. Destructure the first and second elements from an array
2. Use the rest pattern to separate the first item from the rest
3. Create a function that returns multiple values and destructure the result

💰 Rest pattern with types:

```ts
const [first, ...rest]: [number, ...Array<number>] = numbers
```
