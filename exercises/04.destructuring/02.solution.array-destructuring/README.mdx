# Array Destructuring

👨‍💼 Excellent! You've mastered array destructuring.

🦉 Key patterns:

1. **Position-based extraction**: `const [first, second] = arr`
2. **Rest pattern**: `const [head, ...tail] = arr`
3. **Function return destructuring**: `const [min, max] = getMinMax(nums)`

This pattern is foundational for React hooks:

```ts
// useState returns an array you can destructure (also called a "Tuple")
const [count, setCount] = useState(0)

// useReducer too
const [state, dispatch] = useReducer(reducer, initialState)
```

The rest pattern (`...`) is also the foundation for the spread operator, which
you'll use extensively for immutable updates.
