# Array Iteration

👨‍💼 We need to process our inventory data. We'll do this the manual way first
so you can see the baseline before we introduce array methods later.

🐨 Open <InlineFile file="index.ts" /> and:

1. Use `for...of` to log each product
2. Find all products that are in stock
3. Count products over a certain price

💰 `for...of` loops work well with arrays and preserve item types.

💰 Build a filtered list by looping and conditionally pushing.
