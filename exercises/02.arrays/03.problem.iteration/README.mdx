# Array Iteration

👨‍💼 We need to process our inventory data. Let's practice different ways to
iterate over arrays.

🐨 Open <InlineFile file="index.ts" /> and:

1. Use `for...of` to log each product
2. Find all products that are in stock
3. Count products over a certain price

💰 `for...of` with type inference:

```ts
for (const product of products) {
	// TypeScript knows product is { name: string, price: number, ... }
	console.log(product.name)
}
```

💰 Building a filtered list:

```ts
const inStock: ProductType[] = []
for (const product of products) {
	if (product.inStock) {
		inStock.push(product)
	}
}
```
