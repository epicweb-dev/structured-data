# Array Types

👨‍💼 Excellent! Arrays of objects are foundational for real applications.

🦉 You might notice we're repeating the type definition. Creating a small type
alias can keep your array code tidy:

```ts
type Product = { name: string; price: number; inStock: boolean }
const products: Array<Product> = [...]
```
This makes the code cleaner and the type reusable across your application.
