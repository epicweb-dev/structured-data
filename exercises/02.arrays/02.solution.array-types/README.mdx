# Array Types

👨‍💼 Excellent! Arrays of objects are foundational for real applications.

🦉 You might notice we're repeating the type definition. In the next workshop,
you'll learn to create reusable type aliases:

```ts
type Product = { name: string; price: number; inStock: boolean }
const products: Product[] = [...]
```

This makes the code cleaner and the type reusable across your application.
