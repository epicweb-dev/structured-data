# Arrays

Arrays store ordered collections of values. In TypeScript, arrays are typed—you
specify what kind of elements they can contain.

```ts
const numbers: number[] = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
const names: string[] = ['Alice', 'Bob', 'Charlie']
```

## Two Syntax Options

TypeScript offers two ways to write array types:

```ts
// Square bracket syntax (more common)
const numbers: number[] = [1, 2, 3]

// Generic syntax
const numbers: Array<number> = [1, 2, 3]
```

Both are identical—use whichever you prefer, but be consistent.

## Type Safety with Arrays

TypeScript ensures you only put the right types in arrays:

```ts
const numbers: number[] = [1, 2, 3]
numbers.push(4) // ✅ OK
numbers.push('five') // ❌ Error: 'string' not assignable to 'number'
```

## Adding to Arrays: Two Approaches

You can add elements to arrays in two ways:

```ts
// Mutation (modifies the original array)
const numbers: number[] = [1, 2, 3]
numbers.push(4)

// Immutable (creates a new array)
const numbers: number[] = [1, 2, 3]
const moreNumbers = [...numbers, 4]
```

The immutable approach using spread (`...`) is often preferred in modern
JavaScript because it's easier to reason about—the original array stays
unchanged. This is especially important when working with shared data or React
state.

	**When is mutation okay?** If you're building an array locally inside a
	function and not sharing the reference, `push()` is perfectly fine. The
	immutable pattern matters most when data is shared or returned. Pragmatism
	over purity—choose the approach that's clearest for your situation.

## Mixed Arrays

Need different types? Use union types:

```ts
const mixed: (string | number)[] = [1, 'two', 3, 'four']
```

In this exercise, you'll create and work with typed arrays.
