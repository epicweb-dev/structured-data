# Arrays

Arrays store ordered collections of values. In TypeScript, arrays are typed—you
specify what kind of elements they can contain.

```ts
const numbers: number[] = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
const names: string[] = ['Alice', 'Bob', 'Charlie']
```

## Two Syntax Options

TypeScript offers two ways to write array types:

```ts
// Square bracket syntax (more common)
const numbers: number[] = [1, 2, 3]

// Generic syntax
const numbers: Array<number> = [1, 2, 3]
```

Both are identical—use whichever you prefer, but be consistent.

## Type Safety with Arrays

TypeScript ensures you only put the right types in arrays:

```ts
const numbers: number[] = [1, 2, 3]
numbers.push(4) // ✅ OK
numbers.push('five') // ❌ Error: 'string' not assignable to 'number'
```

## Mixed Arrays

Need different types? Use union types:

```ts
const mixed: (string | number)[] = [1, 'two', 3, 'four']
```

	Arrays are one of the most used data structures. Mastering typed arrays is
	essential for working with lists of data.

In this exercise, you'll create and work with typed arrays.
