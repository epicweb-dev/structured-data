# Array Iteration

👨‍💼 You've mastered manual array iteration!

🦉 This imperative approach works, but it requires mutation (building up an
array with `push()`) and is verbose. In the Array Methods exercise, you'll learn
`filter()` and other functional methods that express the same logic more
declaratively:

```ts
// Functional approach - one line, no mutation
const inStockProducts = products.filter((p) => p.inStock)
const expensiveCount = products.filter((p) => p.price > 50).length
```

Understanding the manual approach helps you appreciate—and debug—the functional
methods. Both approaches work; the functional style is often clearer for data
transformation.
