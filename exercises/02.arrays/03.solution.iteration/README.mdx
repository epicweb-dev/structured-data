# Array Iteration

👨‍💼 You've mastered manual array iteration!

🦉 This manual filtering pattern works, but it's verbose. In the Array Methods
exercise, you'll learn `filter()` which does this in one line:

```ts
const inStockProducts = products.filter((p) => p.inStock)
```

Understanding the manual approach helps you appreciate—and debug—the functional
methods.
