# Arrays

👨‍💼 Great work with arrays! You now know how to:

- 📚 Create typed arrays with `Array<Type>` (preferred) or `Type[]`
- ✅ Get type safety when adding elements
- 🔄 Iterate over arrays with `for...of`
- 🎭 Use union types for mixed arrays

🦉 Array types shine when combined with object types:

```ts
type User = { name: string; age: number }
const users: Array<User> = [
	{ name: 'Alice', age: 30 },
	{ name: 'Bob', age: 25 },
]
```

Next up: Tuples—arrays with fixed length and specific types at each position!
