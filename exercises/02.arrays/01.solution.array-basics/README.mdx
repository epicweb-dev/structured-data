# Array Basics

👨‍💼 Perfect! You've mastered basic array operations.

🦉 A common pattern for getting the last element:

```ts
const last = products[products.length - 1]

// Or using at() (newer, cleaner):
const last = products.at(-1) // Negative index counts from end
```

The `at()` method is great for accessing from the end without the `length - 1`
math.
