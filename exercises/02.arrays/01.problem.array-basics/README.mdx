# Array Basics

👨‍💼 We're building an inventory system that tracks products. Let's start with
basic array operations.

🐨 Open <InlineFile file="index.ts" /> and:

1. Create an array of product names (strings)
2. Add a new product using `push`
3. Access elements by index
4. Get the length of the array

💰 Arrays store ordered values; you can push, index, and read length.
