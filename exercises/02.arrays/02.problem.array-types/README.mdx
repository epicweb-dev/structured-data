# Array Types

👨‍💼 Let's work with arrays of objects—a very common pattern in real
applications.

```ts
type User = { name: string; age: number }
const users: Array<User> = [
	{ name: 'Alice', age: 30 },
	{ name: 'Bob', age: 25 },
]
```

🐨 Open <InlineFile file="index.ts" /> and:

1. Create a `Product` type alias with `name`, `price`, and `inStock`
2. Create an array of `Product` objects
3. Add a new product using `push`
4. Access a property of a specific product
5. Calculate the total price using a loop

💰 Use `push` to add objects to arrays.

💰 Use a loop to sum the prices into a total.

<callout-info>
	There's a more concise way to sum arrays with `reduce`, and we'll cover that
	in the Array Methods exercise later.
