# Array Types

👨‍💼 Let's work with arrays of objects—a very common pattern in real
applications.

```ts
const users: { name: string; age: number }[] = [
	{ name: 'Alice', age: 30 },
	{ name: 'Bob', age: 25 },
]
```

🐨 Open <InlineFile file="index.ts" /> and:

1. Create an array of product objects with `name`, `price`, and `inStock`
2. Add a new product using `push`
3. Access a property of a specific product
4. Calculate the total price using a loop

💰 Adding to an array:

```ts
const items: { name: string; price: number }[] = [{ name: 'Item', price: 10 }]
items.push({ name: 'Another', price: 20 })
```

💰 Summing values with a loop:

```ts
let total = 0
for (let i = 0; i < items.length; i++) {
	const item = items[i]
	total += item.price
}
```

	There's a more concise way to sum arrays with `reduce`, and we'll cover that
	in the Array Methods exercise later.
